# Neville Goddard

- Human imagination is all-creating, therefore God.
- Reinterpreted the bible in an esoteric way.
- Neville's Law of Assumption improves on the idea of the Law of Attraction.

## Core tenets
- Assumptions Harden into Facts
- Consciousness is the Only Reality
- Imagination Creates Reality
- Feeling is the Secret (felt thoughts manifest)
- Living in the End (imagine the desired state already achieved)
- You Are the Operant Power (God/Universe is within rather than external)
- There is No One to Change but Self (circumstances/others are a reflection of self)
- We Are All One (whole world is yourself pushed out)
- Time is an Illusion (only now exists)
- You Can Revise the Past

## State Akin To Sleep (SATS)
Method for conscious manifestation.

1) Choose your desire.
2) Identify feeling behind desire. Optionally, use a memory as an anchor for the feeling.
3) Envision scene with desire achieved (not in process), describe scene.
4) Before sleep: relax, reach drowsy, deeply meditative state, experience scene for 10s, replay until asleep, repeat daily.
