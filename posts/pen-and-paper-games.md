# Pen and Paper Games

## Paper-Only (Solo)

### Sudoku

- Players: 1
- Materials: printed Sudoku or a pre-drawn grid, pencil/pen

How to play:

1. Start from a **premade puzzle** (a partially filled 9×9 grid). A totally empty grid isn’t a playable Sudoku.
2. Use a 9×9 grid (divided into nine 3×3 boxes).
3. Fill empty cells with digits 1–9.
4. Each row, column, and 3×3 box must contain 1–9 exactly once.

If you want to make your own:

- Easiest: print/generate a puzzle.
- Harder: start from a completed grid, then erase numbers while keeping a single solution.

### Number Challenge (Make the Number)

- Players: 1 (or co-op)
- Materials: paper, pen; optional: calculator for checking

How to play:

1. Write a **target number** (e.g., 50).
2. Write as many different expressions as you can that equal the target (e.g., `5×10`, `25+25`, `62−12`).
3. Optional constraints: only use certain numbers, require a minimum number of operations, or set a timer.

### Associations Chain

- Players: 1
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. Write a starting word.
2. Write a new word that you strongly associate with the previous word.
3. Continue until you stop; optionally circle your favorite “unexpected” connections.

### Doodling (Variations)

- Players: 1
- Materials: paper, pen/pencil

How to play:

1. Pick a theme (e.g., “plants”, “chairs”, “faces”).
2. Draw as many different versions as you can in 5–10 minutes.

### Blind Drawing (Solo)

- Players: 1
- Materials: paper, pen/pencil

How to play:

1. Close your eyes (or look away).
2. Draw a simple subject (house, tree, stick figure).
3. Open your eyes, then optionally do a second attempt and compare.

### Pangrams

- Players: 1+ (compare results)
- Materials: paper, pen; optional timer

How to play:

1. Write a single sentence that uses **every letter A–Z** at least once.
2. Optional challenges: shortest pangram, funniest pangram, most coherent pangram.

### Words Within a Word

- Players: 1+ (competitive)
- Materials: paper, pen, timer

How to play:

1. Pick a long word (e.g., `ROLLERCOASTER`) and write it at the top.
2. Set a timer (3–5 minutes).
3. Everyone writes as many smaller words as possible using only those letters.
4. Score: 1 point per valid word (or longer words score more).

### Finish the Doodle

- Players: 1+ (taking turns works great)
- Materials: paper, pen/pencil

How to play:

1. Draw a simple random squiggle or partial shape.
2. Finish it into a complete drawing.
3. Variant (pass-and-finish): each person adds 10–20 seconds of work, then passes.

## Paper Strategy & Puzzles (Usually 2 Players)

### Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)

- Players: 2
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. Draw a 3×3 grid.
2. Players alternate marking `X` and `O`.
3. First to make 3 in a row (row/column/diagonal) wins; full grid is a draw.

Variants:

- **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**: draw a 3×3 “mega board” made of nine mini 3×3 boards.
  1. Your move in a mini-board determines which mini-board your opponent must play in next (by position).
  2. If the required mini-board is already won or full, the next player may play anywhere.
  3. Win a mini-board like normal tic-tac-toe; winning three mini-boards in a row wins the game.

### Palms (Number Hunt vs. Scribbles)

- Players: 2
- Materials: paper, pens

How to play:

1. Each player traces their hand on a sheet.
2. Inside the hand outline, write numbers (e.g., 1–20) scattered around.
3. Swap sheets.
4. Round structure:
   - Player A calls a number.
   - Player B searches for it; while they search, Player A rapidly draws marks (e.g., Xs) in a designated “scribble area” on the page.
   - When Player B finds the number, they circle it and Player A stops scribbling.
5. Swap roles; first to fill their scribble area (or find all numbers) wins—pick one win condition before starting.

### Battleship (Sea Battle)

- Players: 2
- Materials: two grids per player (target + fleet), pen/pencil

How to play:

1. Each player draws two 10×10 grids and labels coordinates (A–J and 1–10).
2. Secretly place ships on your **fleet grid**.
   - Classic fleet: 5 ships of sizes `5, 4, 3, 3, 2` (all straight, no diagonals).
   - Agree whether ships may touch (many house rules allow touching; some require 1-cell gaps).
3. Take turns calling a coordinate on the opponent’s grid.
4. Opponent answers **hit** or **miss**; mark results on your **target grid**.
5. When all squares of a ship are hit, it’s sunk. First to sink all ships wins.

### Dots and Boxes

- Players: 2 (works with more)
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. Draw a grid of dots.
2. Players take turns drawing a line between two adjacent dots (no diagonals).
3. You can’t draw a line where a line already exists.
4. Completing the fourth side of a square “claims” it (write your initial inside) and gives you another turn.
5. When no lines remain, most claimed squares wins.

### SOS

- Players: 2+ (works best 2)
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. Draw a grid (e.g., 5×5).
2. On your turn write either `S` or `O` in an empty cell.
3. If your move completes `S-O-S` in a line, score 1 (sequences may overlap unless you ban it).
4. Optional rule: if you score, you take another turn.
4. When the grid is full, highest score wins.

### Mastermind (Number Codebreaker)

- Players: 2 (or 1 vs “the sheet”)
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. One player writes a secret 4-digit code (digits can repeat unless you ban repeats).
2. The guesser writes a 4-digit guess each turn.
3. The codemaker replies with:
   - how many digits are correct **and** in the correct position
   - how many digits are correct but in the wrong position
   (Don’t double-count digits: each digit in the secret can only “match” one digit in the guess.)
4. Keep going until solved; optionally cap guesses for difficulty.

### Paper Soccer (Graph “Kicks”)

- Players: 2
- Materials: graph paper (best), pen/pencil

How to play:

1. Draw a rectangular field with a small goal box on each short side and a starting dot in the center.
2. Players take turns moving the ball by drawing **one segment** from the current dot to a neighboring intersection (edge or diagonal).
3. You may cross existing lines, but you may not draw directly over an existing segment.
4. If the ball hits a boundary or a previously visited point, it “bounces” and you immediately take another move.
5. Each goal is worth 1 point. The first player to score 3 points wins.

### Nim (Paper Version)

- Players: 2
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. Draw several rows of tokens (e.g., 5, 7, 9 circles).
2. On your turn, choose one row and cross out **at least one** token (as many as you want).
3. Alternate until no tokens remain.
4. Choose a win condition before starting:
   - **Normal play**: taking the last token wins.
   - **Misère**: taking the last token loses.

### Sim

- Players: 2
- Materials: paper, pen (two colors helps)

How to play:

1. Draw 6 points in a circle (hexagon-like).
2. Players alternate drawing a line between two unconnected points in their color.
3. First player to complete a triangle (3 lines of their color) **loses**.

### Join 5

- Players: 1–2
- Materials: dot paper or carefully spaced dots, pen

How to play (one common ruleset):

1. Draw the dot layout:
   - Draw a 4×4 square grid of evenly spaced dots.
   - Add a 4×3 rectangle of dots to each side of the square (so the overall shape looks like a plus sign).
2. Take turns drawing a straight line segment that passes through exactly **5 dots** in a row.
3. Constraints:
   - The line can’t reuse any previously drawn segment.
   - Exactly **one** of the five dots must be a “new” dot that wasn’t used in any previous line (track used dots by circling them).
4. If you can’t make a legal line on your turn, you lose (or end the game and compare who made more lines).

## Word Games (2+)

### Hangman (and Drawing Variants)

- Players: 2+ (1 host, 1+ guessers)
- Materials: paper, pen

How to play:

1. The host chooses a secret word and draws blanks (`_ _ _`) for each letter.
2. Guessers propose letters one at a time.
3. Correct guesses fill in the blanks; incorrect guesses add a “mistake mark.”
4. Guessers win by completing the word before mistakes run out.

Variants (same rules, different “mistake drawing”):

- **Spaceman / Snowman**: draw an astronaut or snowman piece by piece.
- **Apple Tree**: draw a tree with a fixed number of apples; wrong letters fill apples until full.

### Word Tennis (Associative Rally)

- Players: 2+
- Materials: paper (optional), timer (optional)

How to play:

1. Choose a starting word (e.g., “mouse”).

- Materials: paper, pen

How to play (one simple version):

1. Write a starting word in the center of a page.
2. On your turn, add exactly **one letter** somewhere in the word **without reordering the existing letters** (you’re inserting one letter).
3. The new word must be a valid word and can’t have been used before.
4. If you can’t move, you pass; if everyone passes in a row, the game ends.
5. Scoring options (pick one):
   - 1 point per valid new word
   - “Survival”: last player able to play wins

### Word Square (4×4 Grid)

How to play:

1. Pick a weird real word and write it where everyone can see.
2. Everyone secretly writes a fake definition (plus the real one if you’re hosting).
